Dummy AI are called the 'Alien squid people' and are for testing any future zombie mode option we might add. The fact they are the easiest to get working is why wilderness survival and hunting might seem a bit extreme at the moment. Being involved in an Alien Invasion of squid people is up to you with the 'R' key. They are more intellegent than you may think. Press 'N' if you want a giant AI. Only once we have the core of the game working will we start to take it more seriously as until that point nothing is certain. Development remains ongoing as UE4 is a new engine for myself, the programmer and 3d artist, so keep the faith as we create this concept in an engine which is being updated. Delays with the map were due to engine updates and now that we can finalize the open world and navigation for the AI things will progress well, we hope. Now that the map size (20x20km) has been settled on the environment can now start to be filled out a bit more and game features worked out for harvesting trees as well as planting and base building. What you grow, hunt, trap and find will be all that keeps you from starving to death out in the wilderness. No tins of beans are included so dont expect to find any growing from a tree or just laying around. What species of plantlife, wildlife and extra terrestrial we may add is all part of the learning curve. The arcade action gameplay will be slowed down in time to a more simulator expereince once we have everything we want in added.  This download will be the last dev build to feature the 200x200km Open World Map. All future dev at the moment is on the 20 x 20 km Open World Environment. If you have suggestion then let us know as the game is made for PC Open World Survival Game Fans. Download Here The Inventory will be filled out and the player forced to scavange for supplies in order to keep them alive. AI will be expanded upon for the first land animals to hunt, basic ducks are already in V0.22. Block building will get a makeover and have more options put in. Harvesting and planting will go beyond the tree only setup and allow you to plant crops in order to collect them later in the year and long winter months. We should hopefuly have winter included by then as well.   From the above we will now start to link the parts together and start to experiment with gameplay now that we are able to. Its going to be basic but we hope an enjoyable and fun open world survival game expereince is there for hunters, survivalists, openworlders and zombie fans. The genre may be packed already but as far as we are concerned there can never be enough open world survival games available as openworld is the only world and only way to go. 20x20km may be too much to handle but at least you aint on rails :) Go anywhere and eventually go underground as well.  To Ride a duck keep pressing K until one picks you up. Trying to shoot ducks while riding one at the same time is of course a skill almost all real world survival experts possess.  A prototype open world survival and hunting sim remains the goal but we need to go through an arcade phase of development first to get there. So stick with us as its going to get very bloody for a while as the zombie AI is left to run about for testing. If Ai testing isnt your thing try construction and exploring the map as we need your opinions to help us make it better for you. The mercenaries will soon be fitted out with weapons so expect to start being hunted and tracked down soon enough, and yes we know you need a scope. Lots to still be added but its good to know we are now on phase two and can tick off some core features such as the map, lighting, shadows, Ai navigation and more.
